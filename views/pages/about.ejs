  <section class="about-text">
    <p>
      At UGA's Mary Frances Early College of Education, our team is at the
      forefront of integrating AI into rehabilitation, focusing on precise motor
      function analysis. With a Master's in Computer Science in progress, the
      work includes developing models to accurately track hand and finger
      movements, vital for advancing clinical assessments.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a strong foundation in computer science, my expertise spans data
      science, machine learning, and web application development. During my
      undergraduate studies, I refined my skills in data analysis and mining
      techniques and developed proficiency in data structures and algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
      My graduate education has equipped me with a deep understanding of
      full-stack development, including Node.js, React,MongoDB, Express.js and
      deploying applications on Azure and AWS for efficient load balancing. I am
      flexible and experienced in working with both cloud ecosystems, leveraging
      their services to optimize performance, scalability, and resource
      management. Additionally, my experience as a research assistant in
      computer vision and machine learning has provided me with hands-on
      exposure to data analysis techniques, video processing, and algorithm
      development
    </p>
    <p>
      I am passionate about building end-to-end, data-driven solutions,
      developing machine learning workflows, developing and deploying full-stack
      applications in the cloud to deliver impactful, scalable results.
