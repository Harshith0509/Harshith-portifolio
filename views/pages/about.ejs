  <section class="about-text">
    <p>
      I’m Harshith Kasthuri, a Software Engineer and graduate student in
      Computer Science at the University of Georgia. I enjoy building systems
      that are reliable, scalable, and easy for people to use. My journey in
      tech has been shaped by a mix of research and industry work, where I’ve
      learned how to take an idea from the ground up and turn it into something
      practical and impactful. What excites me most is solving complex problems
      through thoughtful design and clean, efficient code.
    </p>

    <p>
      At UGA’s CoDex Lab, I’ve been working on projects that connect software
      engineering with healthcare and rehabilitation. I’ve helped develop 3D
      game-based rehabilitation environments, built data pipelines that cut down
      manual processing time, and set up cloud workflows that made research
      experiments easier and faster to run. Before that, I worked as a Software
      Development Engineer at Vanna Information Technologies, where I built
      microservices in Go and Java, integrated large databases, and designed
      front-end dashboards in React and TypeScript. Those experiences taught me
      how to create systems that perform well under real-world demands while
      keeping the user experience front and center. During my undergraduate
      years, I was an active contributor to the Computer Society of India (CSI)
      as a student volunteer(Open-source). I supported the organizing team in planning and
      running events, while also helping with the development and upkeep of the
      organization’s website. My role included creating and managing surveys and
      feedback forms, as well as maintaining the student member database to
      ensure smooth communication and record-keeping. This experience gave me an
      early exposure to teamwork, responsibility, and applying my technical
      skills in a community-driven setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of my roles, I’ve taken on projects like building distributed
      transaction systems, multilingual chat platforms, and full-stack
      applications with scalable database designs. Along the way, I was honored
      to receive the Best Poster Award at UGA’s Research Day for my work on
      markerless hand tracking for rehabilitation. My technical strengths
      include Go, Java, Python, React/TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, and
      AWS, but more importantly, I bring curiosity, adaptability, and the drive
      to build solutions that make a difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m passionate about building end-to-end, data-driven solutions—from
      designing machine learning workflows to developing and deploying
      full-stack applications in the cloud. My goal is to create systems that
      are both impactful and scalable, while staying grounded in real-world
      needs. I’m eager to contribute to the development of emerging technologies
      and be part of work that makes a meaningful impact.
